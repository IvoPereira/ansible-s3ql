# s3ql Data will be encrypted by default
# - works with Google Storage, Amazon S3 etc. when using the appropriate storage url
# - possible to create multiple s3ql filesystems per server,
#     by calling the role more than once with different variables
# - does not check, if buckets already contain a s3ql filesystem
# - not really tested much with other user/group than root
