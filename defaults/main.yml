# --allow-other Normally, only the user who called mount.s3ql can access the mount point.
# This user then also has full access to it, independent of individual file permissions.
# If the --allow-other option is specified, other users can access the mount point as well
# and individual file permissions are taken into account for all users.
# --allow-root 	Like --allow-other, but restrict access to the mounting user and the root user.
